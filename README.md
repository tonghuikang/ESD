# Current Initiatives
## Pillar Dialogue 
We aim to have this as a termly event.
<br>
**Aim: To provide an avenue for the sharing of important updates and address questions and concerns**
**Format:**
* Pre-survey of Key Topics
* Pre-survey of burning questions/concerns
* Pillar Dialogue (open invite of ESD population)
* Post-email of minutes and key points to the population

## Course Planner
We aim to ease the planning process for students and admin staff regarding to the ever more complicating course/track/minor requirements.
<br><br>
**Currently stable version of the planner is available [here](https://course-planner.opensutd.org/)**
<br>
The current version is reactive<br>
In future development, we would also like to make a recommendation system for course-plan/module given student's strength or interest.

** This is a constant process of updating and maintaining the planner, and we seek interested people to join this open source project. Please email ```zhi_zhou@mymail.sutd.edu.sg``` if interested.
